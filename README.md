### <span style = 'color:green'>problem statement : detect credit card fraud transactions using Logistic Regression</span>


- Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm used to make predictions to find the value of a dependent variable such as the condition of a tumor (malignant or benign), classification of email (spam or not spam), or admission into a university (admitted or not admitted) by learning from independent variables (various features relevant to the problem).

**Difference between Logistic and Linear Regression**
The major difference between Logistic and Linear Regression is that Linear Regression is used to solve regression problems whereas Logistic Regression is used for classification problems.

**About the dataset**
- The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions



**Expected output**
- **Use histogram to represent to all the data**
- **Use Classification Report for scores**
- **Plot confusion matrix**
